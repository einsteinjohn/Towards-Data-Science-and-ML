# Machine learning and SQL
Welcome to my ML and SQL repo. This will be a channel where I put in all of my code and projects for SQL,data science and Machine learning projects. every project will have it's own folder and possibly a README for instructions on how to use it. Codes are in master branches. 

#NB: Some of the projects posted on here don't have the data clean-up or any data at all because the data isn't public and are still under research by the professor I was working with. The data will be published by professor once everything is complete.
