# Machine learning and SQL
Welcome to my ML and SQL repo. This will be a channel where I put in some of my code and projects for SQL,data science and Machine learning projects. every project will have it's own folder and possibly a README for instructions on how to use it. Codes are in master branch. 

#NB: Some of the projects posted on here don't have the data, nor clean-up process or any data at all because the project isn't public (private research) and are still under research by the professor I was working with.

These are some of my projects and may or may not be updated in the coming days.
